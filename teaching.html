          This graduate course is designed for advanced undergraduates and
          graduate students interested in exploring the principles of
          Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). The course covers standard
          Model-Driven Development (MDD) techniques and methodologies applied in
          industry and teaches students how to leverage MDE methodologies to
          design and build domain-specific languages. This project-based course
          offers students opportunities to collaborate with industry partners,
          such as NASA JPL, on real-world applications.

            This graduate course is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students interested in exploring key concepts such as abstraction, modularity, separation of concerns, and reuse. The course covers standard Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques and methodologies widely used in industry, as well as advanced MDE topics aimed at enhancing modularity, separation of concerns, and reuse. These advanced topics include aspect-orientation and concern-oriented reuse.

            This undergraduate course provides students with a strong foundational understanding of how to integrate programming with Model-Driven Development principles. Students learn to design and implement software applications, progressing from requirements elicitation and analysis to architectural design, implementation, and deployment, all while applying model-based approaches to create efficient and reliable software systems. Working in groups, students design and develop simple games, combining model-driven techniques with programming to reinforce their learning.

            This undergraduate course provides students the opportunity to learn key techniques for eliciting 
            requirements, as well as languages and models for specifying them. It covers analysis and validation 
            methods, including feature-based, goal-based, and scenario-based analysis, along with approaches 
            to addressing quality requirements, traceability, and management. Students learn to handle the 
            evolution of requirements, apply requirements documentation standards, and understand requirements 
            within the context of system engineering. The course also emphasizes the integration of requirements 
            engineering into broader software engineering processes.

            requirements elicitation and specification, architectural and
            detailed design, implementation, deployment, and maintenance.
            Throughout the project, students adopt a model-driven engineering
            approach, creating software models at various levels of abstraction
            using different modeling formalisms. The final implementation is
            completed by the students using an object-oriented programming
            language of their choice.
